Code for DC 5/22 Observations & ideas:
- Something of value might be a "bus stop quality" score, based on how reliable the buses at that stop are. How does this factor into bus access?
- Given historical commute data, what is the travel time for those commuters if they took the bus? How many transfers would they have?
- back to the question of where are bottlenecks & where are the slowest buses... where do we need a bus lane??
